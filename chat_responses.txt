Simplified Explanation of What They Are Saying: The discussion highlights that a transaction-based business model generally generates less revenue per visit compared to an ad-based model. This is because ads can generate higher revenue due to their potential reach and the ability to show multiple ads per visit, while transaction-based models typically rely on individual purchases or interactions that generate lower earnings per visit. The mention of "cactel TV" indicates that the ad model was previously discussed as a higher revenue-generating method.

Term: Valuation 
Snippet: "So that's the distortion effect for, you know, either those rounds directly or for everybody else in the space, it's like, yes, X company got a $20 billion valuation from a non-economic, you know, actor that does not make your your revenue or your multiple have any correlation to that because the acquisition premium or the ultimate cash flow of this company doesn't have any relationship to, to the credit model that just, you know, got a deal done."
Definition: The process of determining the worth or economic value of a company, asset, or investment opportunity. It involves analyzing various factors such as revenues, cash flows, market conditions, and comparable transactions to estimate the fair value.
Simplified Explanation of What They Are Saying: The discussion highlights the distortion effect caused by the valuations given to certain companies in the space. The valuation of a company, such as the $20 billion valuation mentioned, can be influenced by non-economic actors and may not directly correlate with the company's revenue or valuation multiples. This is because the acquisition premium (the extra amount paid over the fair value of the company) and the potential cash flow of the company don't necessarily align with the credit model used to determine the valuation. This can create discrepancies in the perceived value of companies and lead to challenges in measuring their true worth.

Term: Cash flow 
Snippet: "And if you can't get a financial investor to invest alongside because these are non-cash credits, then you don't have the cash to do the second areas and you can't keep up."
Definition: The net amount of cash and cash equivalents flowing into and out of a business over a specific period. It indicates the liquidity and financial health of a company by showing its ability to generate income and manage its expenses.
Simplified Explanation of What They Are Saying: The discussion points out that the availability of cash is important for a company to continue its operations and growth. In the context of the snippet, if a company is unable to secure investment from financial investors because the credits they are offering are non-cash (not actual cash), it may face challenges in obtaining the necessary funds for certain activities. This can hinder the company's ability to keep up with its competitors or pursue growth opportunities.
