But more importantly, people refer to you as an old soul. Now, I looked that word up. It's actually, it's not derogatory at all. It doesn't even mean you're old. It means you're wise beyond your years. Now, I know you're not 40 yet, so you're two decades short of me.

I can certainly get into the different areas. There was about a three-year period where we raised a ton of capital and we burned it. And we did have a little bit of Zerp benefit, but it was actually like on paper exactly the right thing to do at that point. I got diluted a ton in the process as a result, but it was actually like strategically the most important thing to be doing. But history of the company super quickly and kind of what we do. So we built a platform that helps companies manage their most important data, their financial documents, their marketing materials, their contracts, their strategy, you know, content, anything that can turn into a piece of content we manage and store and secure. We have about 115,000 customers, 70% of the Fortune 500. And we started the company with a really simple premise. This was in 2004, 2005 when we got the idea. It was like right at the start where like you could put data in the cloud. It wasn't called the cloud then. We did like crazy bridge rounds and all this stuff. I think we pitched Bill like four times at that point. Handily got rejected, you know, probably appropriate, probably appropriately. And or maybe it was Peter Fenton. So but we can blame it on him. And and then pivoted to the enterprise and then just got super lucky, which was there was this hyper wave of cloud with AWS, iPhone and then iPad. And what happened was everybody's legacy technology no longer worked in this area. And so we were able to kind of ride that wave where we just had a better, cheaper, faster, more secure platform than what else was on the market. And and then that was sort of the period where we just we just poured the fuel on the on the fire on hiring sales reps, hiring engineers, building out a platform and then scaling up to basically where we are today. So that, you know."

And so you've lived through, you know, a lot of different, you know, spots on the curve. And, you know, I've always said that Silicon Valley has the crudest kind of least intelligent view of valuation. They always rush to price to revenue because it's easy and because, quite frankly, it's easier to be optimistic. And so and then the other thing that happens in Silicon Valley, all founders kind of tie themselves to a single number. So 10 times revenue or something. And Brad brought Brad has some data. And, you know, on the first slide, I think the average multiple for a SaaS company is is now six, which is actually not that bad. Yeah, but that's great. But even to say the average is is misleading because the dispersion is so great."

        "transcript": " I mean, you guys have done more content and thought leadership on this than probably any two people in the world. Not all software companies are created equal. Not all technology companies are created equal. I think we clearly have been through a period, you know, probably due to just the influx of capital. Maybe this is the Zerp element, Brad, that you're kind of referring to is like, if you're like one click or two clicks removed from Sand Hill Road, and Sand Hill's equally to probably blame at certain points, you're sort of like, oh, tech enabled everything should all get a 6 or 10x revenue multiple when the underlying economics of this business could be literally 100x difference. You could have like a 5 or 10% margin company versus a 90% margin, 95% margin company. But yet the outside capital inflow is treating those as exactly the same revenue multiple, which is obviously diabolically crazy. Our own journey has been a little bit really simple because we've always sort of traded somewhere between like $4. We've never had the crazy high multiple. We never, you know, we haven't also been totally sort of forgotten about at any point. And I think that's a result of, you know, we've always had basically between 70% and 80% gross margin, somewhere in the 100% to 120% net retention rate. And so the economics kind of always work out that, okay, you kind of know the underlying contours of the business model. But yeah, I mean, I think we've been for too long treated all software and all technology indiscriminately as, as sort of, you know, like it should be an 80% gross margin company, you know, with a, with a, you know, a triple digit net retention rate. And that's just not the case. So, I mean, I kind of almost flip it back to you guys on like, you know, how do you think, do we come back to forgetting about the differences or is this now a much more sort of normal environment that sustains?"

You know, here we are actually looking at this growth adjusted. And you can see that, you know, we had this major spike during the period of 20 and 21, right? So this is normalizing for growth. We fell all the way back down to this 10-year average, and now we're above it, you know, again, on a growth-adjusted basis. If you go to the next slide, you know, we said, okay, let's look at it from a free cash flow multiple perspective, Aaron. And what you've seen here is that a lot of companies like Box have said during this period of 2021, whoa, we got to focus on profitability, not so much on growth, because we may not raise that next round of financing. So everybody got a lot more profitable. So on a free cash flow basis, you know, the multiples are actually trending right around that 10-year average. You see this next slide, which I think points out really well."

So everybody had to fund themselves. Then we entered this period again, you know, around Zerp where everybody said, oh, I guess it's just growth at all costs. And who cares about profitability? And now we're seeing the return to that. But the final chart, at least at least on this bit that I thought would be interesting. You know, everybody talks about the rule of 40."

You know, like, you know, just to just to calibrate, you have one of the highest free cash flow margins, I think, you know, in the software universe, around 29 percent. But currently are kind of that mid single digit growth rate. And I think this is the point that Bill talks about that I'm super interested in, because you have to deal with the animal instincts of the market. And there are certain phases of the market where they're valuing growth really highly and certain phases of the market where they're valuing profitability really highly. It sounds like you just kind of, you know, ignored Zerp a bit, didn't get caught up in this. But when you looked around, right, Frank Slootman said to me, probably in 2021, most software companies in Silicon Valley are walking dead and they don't even know it."

And I think there's been a clear wake up call to, you know, let's just say, you know, my contemporary group of, you know, 2010 onward SaaS companies, where, you know, we benefited from relatively cheap capital, you know, relatively high valuations, we could use that capital to, again, grow at all costs. I would, you know, if I represent, you know, probably many of the names on this group, I think that was the exactly right economic decision at the time, there was sort of a market share war, you were you were acquiring customers that maybe had a sort of a five or 10 year, you know, kind of lifetime value curve association. You know, of course, you're, you know, you're, you know, you're likely to have a lot of market share, but you're probably the one that's associated with them, maybe even more.

Like, like all of these very boring things actually just mean you can be more capital efficient and still grow at the same rate. And, you know, we had we had a fantastic board, they were pushing us and governing us appropriately on these things. But there's lots of little, little tiny, you know, single decisions that can be the difference of of an extra five or 10% dilution in some cases. And, and, you know, if I could go back, I maybe would be incrementally more thoughtful on a bunch of those. But the underlying element of grow at all costs, get market share, you know, get to 100,000 customers, I think was pretty important. And I think so is true for the Slack and Okta and Zooms of the world. Now, some of those names. You know, sort of, I would just would, you know, mostly blame Wall Street. Some of those names got, got, you know, so hyper accelerated into the future on on their valuations, you know, way outside, you know, what the market was actually going to going to be able to, to actually support. And so then then that's why you have this, you know, crazy volatility of multiples, you know, versus either revenue or free cash flow. And, and then now, obviously, and, you know, I think companies sort of invested, you know, maybe as a result of, of, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you, you know, you, you know, you know, you, you know, from Wall Street and, and then now are obviously pulling back. But I, I think that from a public company standpoint, I think the message is clear. Everybody understands. I think the private market probably still a little bit different. Cause you can do this under the covers. You don't have, you're not, you're not going to get judged on a quarterly basis on, you know, how much have you reduced your expenses? And, you know, there's probably less risk of getting a letter from Brad you know, in the, in those kinds of environments. So that is a huge risk these days."

        "transcript": " The there's probably a few that are just like literally the underlying business model economics. Like I'm a big believer in gross margin. Your gross margin will ultimately determine your operating margin. There's almost no way that you can you can kind of make those two, you know, kind of get out of sync. And so if you're if you're subsidizing something or, you know, or in just such a commodity business and you're, you know, 40, 50, 60 percent gross margin, like there's just like no way you're going to have an operating margin. It looks like a software company. Understanding your gross margin, managing to gross margin, I think is super important. You know, all forms of LTV CAC are probably good. I don't know what the latest, you know, make, you know, everybody every two years is a new term in the industry that is used. But like something that just shows that you can acquire a customer profitably and whether the payback is a year or two years or three years almost doesn't matter as much as as do you do, you know, ultimately generate a long a long term, you know, sticky customer. I think cash flow is super important. I've definitely like I've gotten religion on cash flow. And I think companies getting the cash flow sooner is a is a really good move. I think it pushes the business to be super focused. There was a lot of, again, kind of sloppiness around the edges that we had in our in our hyper growth years that if we if we maybe had had cash flow as a more top of mind metric, we probably could have executed the same results. But around the margin, we would have been just doubling down the things that were working, the incremental international region that was sort of like, you know, we were just betting on we probably would have waited to invest in. And and then ultimately, again, you know, burn less cash, gotten to the same point. So I think cash flow is, you know, I definitely encourage founders to raise less than than I would have five or 10 years ago and focus more on on, you know, self self-sustaining business models."

And at the end of the day, you know, like Bill has this aphorism that, you know, venture capital ultimately follows the public markets, right? And founders follow venture capital. And the reality is that part of the reason Bill and I, I think, are such advocates for getting into the public market sooner as a founder, whether, you know, like Benioff did and Bezos did and so many others, is because it exacts a bit of a discipline. But Bessemer came out with an analysis last week. We have a chart on this I want to pull up called Rule of X, right? And I would love to see us get rid of Rule of 40 and start talking about Rule of X. Because what Rule of X does is it acknowledges something that all investors know to be true, which is growth and margin is not treated equal, right? And so, you know, for everybody, you know, who may not be as familiar with Rule of 40, it's this idea that if you have a 20% free cash flow margin and a 20% growth rate, then you're at a Rule of 40. Right? And I think in the case of Box, Aaron, you know, if you take your, let's call it 20, 30% free cash flow margin and, you know, and 5% growth rate even, you know, that would be a, you know, a 35%, you know, 35 on the Rule of 40. Right."

But if you look at it over time, the average has been two to three. And I asked my team to actually plot the regression on this now just so I could see what today are we valuing the most. And that's this next chart, which basically shows growth is being valued at about three times, right, in the rule of 40 calculation. You know, what margin is being valued at. So I think one of the things I would like to see change in the nomenclature from the investment community in Silicon Valley is that we get over this enslavement to rule of 40.

I guess the question would be, in this model, if you have a 40% growth company at exactly 0% or whatever, it doesn't have to be 40, but 0% cash flow and whatever the growth rate is, how do you use your judgment to decide when will that company be able to actually produce the cash flow? And do the underlying economics sort of support that? And so then you don't have sort of these money pit burning companies getting valued in the same way as the snowflake, let's say, or a workday or whatever, who you kind of deeply understand it's going to be a 30% or 40% margin company at some kind of point in the future. So you have to have some way to kind of normalize for that. Because again, not all growth rates are changeable. They're created equal as well. And I don't exactly know how you do that other than just individual company analysis to just think through, what are the pricing pressure dynamics in this industry going to be? What part of this particular product gets commoditized? Where is there going to be longstanding moat, for lack of a better term? And unfortunately, none of these models sort of capture that when you look at a regression line. So I don't know how to solve that. No, no, no."

But like, you know, I would see either IPO filings or, you know, analyst reports of, OK, you have a company growing at, you know, 30, 40 percent or something. And and then you'd apply the same the same revenue multiple on that company as as, let's say, a snowflake or whatnot. But but one has a 90 percent retention rate or something, which means which means that sales and marketing is required forever to refuel the customer base because of the churn rate of that product. And it means you'll never actually converge on you'll never actually converge on on cash flow at the level of a company with, you know, let's say a 110 retention rate or whatnot. Because because the moment you you stop spending on sales and marketing, that customer will drop. The company will drive their customers and they won't have any cash flow. So but like but like from afar, they were like plotting on the regression line, you know, like they should be funded or, you know, like the valuation should be a snowflake. So that's I don't know how how, you know, I mean, the market eventually kind of gets that right on a per name or category basis. But but I do think like if you don't really understand the dynamics of of these these categories, it gets easy to to sort of not understand, like, well, how will this company actually produce real cash flow in the future? In three or five or 10 years out."

I've noticed over many years of investing in startups that a lot of times the product market fit of the first product will get you, especially a really good product market fit, will get you to 100 million or 200 million or some really large level. But then start to peter out and then you have to figure out other growth drivers. And so I imagine, you know, just based at the scale you're at, you've had that kind of thought process, like how do we drive growth for a more mature startup or a company that's a little bit further along? Any hints for everybody? Yeah."

And, and so, you know, as a founder, you always think your first category is going to be just insanely massive. And so, so you can kind of run the clock on that. And we were really, I think we actually paid a lot of attention to this around kind of three, four, 500 million in revenue. We said, Okay, what's our next act? And, and I think McKinsey, you know, this, this analysis, like 10 years ago, around, you know, around when your second act has to happen in your growth curve, or else, or else you basically just Peter out. So we got like, pretty obsessed with that. And, and, and so our second act was really our platform business, which turned us from just being an application that you bought, you know, at an end user license to then you buy actually, like our platform utilization. And that that that certainly worked, that gave us a boost that has had different characteristics than than just getting us to the billion as quickly as we wanted. So we had to get into security and workflow. So so it's like, we're like, we're beyond like second act. And it's more like we've got multiple, you know, kind of additional capabilities that we monetize. But you do have to there, there's definitely like a finessing to your, your product strategy, your go to market strategy, like, we used to be like, super skew oriented, and then we had to rebundle things. And so your whole company is sort of, you know, riding these, these shifts in, in some kind of, you know, kind of concerted way. And it's interesting, like, part of this, you know, part of this as like a founder, and just your own kind of like, acknowledgement of where you are in the journey is sort of saying, okay, like, there's two kinds of companies, maybe out there, let's just like two kinds of successful companies out there."

There's only one way to do that. That's through the application of AI. We're seeing their monetization also up a lot. You know, but here's the thing that I think is so impressive. Right. They nearly tripled their earnings per employee. Right there. Their headcount in Q3 of 22 was 87,000. This quarter, they reported 67,000. So they're doing this while they're like they really believe that flatter is faster. And I think there are a lot of people who are cutting 9 percent or 12 percent or this or that.

But that's an interesting take. I, I, I honestly am so done with trying to guess when this thing runs out. Like it is. I think we just have to honest like you basically are just is an uncapped, unknowable total amount of addressable market in this space. There are there are clear differences between the hyperscalers and the rest of software simply because a company can just move their their core data center infrastructure from their, you know, their current colo and server providers to the cloud. And, you know, some software providers will make money in that transition. But that's that's basically 90 percent hyperscaler benefit. And so that doesn't sort of all show up in the rest of software and SaaS in the same way. So there's some kind of tale of two cities of of of these massive. Infrastructure migration where the hyperscalers are just, you know, again, an uncapped market opportunity for for these guys. And then there's a lot of surrounding services like you would imagine that as this goes up, the snowflakes and confluence and and whatnot also also see some benefit because there's lots of data services that you need around that. But but yeah, we're not seeing any slowdown of of companies that we talk to just continuing to be moving to the cloud. I get the fortune of talking to, I don't know, you know, dozens of. You know, dozens of. You know, dozens of. You know, dozens of. CIOs a month and and there's nobody that is sort of like done with their cloud journey. There's nobody even at 90 percent. And this is across every every sector of the economy. So we're still weirdly relatively early. And then to Adam's point, like, yeah, like that's even pre-AI. AI is just in the experimentation phase for all intents and purposes in in the enterprise right now. And so we don't even have the AI TAM, you know, quite understood from a software infrastructure standpoint yet."

That's like a scary environment to then be investing, you know, and leading into. Whether it's a software company or an insurance provider in Minneapolis, like like we're all kind of thinking about this the same way. Fast forward to today, you know, OK, inflation coming down, clearly interest rates either at the peak or starting to come down at some point. Like I feel like, OK, we could invest a bit more, which means that that that incremental application we wanted to launch that had some data consumption as a part of it. You know, the the extra focus of the engineers working on optimization versus innovation. You can kind of tune that knob a little bit. And so I think that's the that's the sort of qualitative not captured in the, you know, econometrics, you know, kind of elements of this that are actually happening now in businesses, which gives me a little bit of, you know, incremental confidence that that means CIOs are going to be putting on on more growth initiatives going forward."

        "transcript": " Well above my pay grade, fortunately. I am just a lowly enterprise software person. But, you know, so as a reminder, obviously, for everybody, like Innovator's Dilemma is about business model, you know, difficulties. And we always think it's a technology problem. It's always about your business model doesn't make the new thing attractive to you. And so you avoid doing it until you get disrupted. You know, I might take after, you know, think about this a little bit, maybe not enough, is I don't think there is a totally 100% classic Innovator's Dilemma issue with the move to AI with Google. I think on the other end of this, the business model could be as good, if not better. And Brad, you think about this a lot of like, if you actually had Google literally tell you the thing to buy, and they got a transaction on that, it would actually be a similar business model. They would just get you to that answer even faster. And you'd still transact and you still do commerce. And they are still the distribution engine for all of the people that need to advertise somewhere. Like, everybody has to find a customer. And so you still need an interface to get my product into that customer's hands. And so if Google's AI is doing that better than the 10 Blue Link model, that's great. I actually think that the more complicated thing is probably more of a product management. User behavior experience issue, which is how do I navigate my customer base? How do I navigate my user base to this model in a way where in the process, I don't get totally hammered by that journey? And I don't know how to do that. Like, like Bart is clearly their way of experimenting to do that. But like, you know, their big problem is like, you go to a search box, you type in a search, and they give you a lot of results. And perplexity and chat to BT are just totally different product interfaces. And so they can't clearly make the Google homepage just do that. And so they can't clearly make the Google homepage just do that. So they have to kind of."

Now, I will leave like one big X factor, which is just like maybe our brains are the limiter here. And like ChatGPT just owns that little slot in our brain of you ask a question, get an answer.

That's not even at the top. It's like five links down. I have to find it and get around the ads. So that's one. Two, you already mentioned the business model. Their business model is to throw their customers in a cage match and let them compete with one another to the death. And that drove revenue sky high because it created super optimal payment. And no one wants to see four or five ads. You're not going to get to the same revenue per visit. With a transaction model that you do with the ad model because you already mentioned Cactel TV. People will pay using marketing math 40, 50, 60% of first purchase with a transactional integration. They want to pay 5%.

You know, you brought up, you know, a subject on on our episode one, Aaron. We talked about, you know, these interesting investments made by one of my partners had called Mang. So investments by Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Google into the big model businesses. Bill suggested, you know, that at a very minimum, that's low quality revenue. But, you know, this credit for investment thing is we've seen historically in the past. It wasn't lost on me that the very next day that the FTC came out. I think we have a tweet on this. It was on Squawk, you know, and said, hey, we're going to look into the nature of these relationships, you know, between, you know, the open eyes and and Microsoft's, et cetera. So, Bill, just to close that one out before we jump into our third time.

It's like, yes, X company got a $20 billion valuation from a non-economic actor that does not make your revenue or your multiple have any correlation to that because the acquisition premium or the ultimate cash flow of this company doesn't have any relationship to the credit model that just got a deal done."

And every single one of those files has more value inside of the file than what currently the customer is getting benefit from. Because you have to open up the file, look at it, read it, watch it to get actual real commercial economic benefit of that content. With AI, you now have little bots that can run around and do things on that content to generate more value for you. You could get a decision in your business faster. You could summarize a contract and accelerate a workflow. You could extract data from something that's unstructured to automate a process that was unautomatable before. So that's why it's incredibly exciting for us. The dynamic right now is I think we have... We are still... Even though we're a year and a quarter into Chachaputee phenomenon, we're still literally in the earliest of days. I think most enterprises right now are just in the experimental period. They are trying to figure out... Where to plug AI into their overall stack. I don't think anybody has fully figured that out commonly across normal corporations. And that means that it's anybody's game right now in terms of the winners and losers of AI. I think I probably prefer incumbents in software on the margin right now, because it's so important to have the customer data in an environment that is already trusted, is already secure. They don't have to move the information back and forth. They often already have the workflow. So if I'm thinking about who wins in CRM AI, it's to me Salesforce as opposed to a startup. ITSM AI, it's ServiceNow versus a startup. That's the quick thing because there's not as much innovators dilemma in the pure software categories. In fact, this is just really an advantage for anybody, again, who has users, data, and workflows. AI is like this dream come true, because now we can just... Literally offer more value to our customers. So that's in the classic incumbent categories. I'm extremely bullish for startups. They're just not going to probably be about disrupting known categories of software. It's probably much more about known categories of the economy. And so I think if we spent the past 20 to 30 years putting software, making it so software is a layer above what humans do, now we're at a point where software will just do what the human did. And that creates a whole new vector of opportunities. And I think the classic way to look at this is figure out which parts of knowledge work can convert into tokens. And then those are the areas where there's new software opportunities that we did not have software for before. And then those are the businesses. So I think there'll be trillions of dollars made in AI. But I think it's going to be in verticals. It's going to be helping augment the people element of the work. It's going to be in verticals. It's going to be helping augment the people element of the work. It's going to be in the infrastructure and the scaffolding around it.

And then all of a sudden, you know, now, you know, there's just this leapfrog moment of technology. And, you know, the thing that I go back to is like, there's rarely been technology, I think we've seen where the actual like, like the thing you're building, the asset you're building, is almost perishable, as a piece of IP, like, like the thing literally, like, can just become obsolete, like a second later, and you can't update it, you don't, like, I can't take, I can't take the obsolete thing and make it a little better, I have to like rerun the training run, and then like do the new model.

And the reason he said he did that was because humans' imagination is much grander than anything I could possibly put on the screen. And, you know, we had AI before LLMs. Like I heard Nikesh bring this up once. And so but in our modern lexicon, we think of AI as chat GPT and what the LLM did. That's what really shocked us.

I would literally, I would never want to go and manage servers again. But now here we are, it's 2024 and you have the biggest growth rates, you know, from a dollar standpoint still happening. And so why is it taking 18 years for that still to occur? It's because there's somebody in a data center in Minneapolis that still has to just move the data. They have to move the services into the cloud. And so the equivalent of this is we'll talk to a customer and they say, you know, we'll show them the demo of AI can now read that invoice. And and do what the human was doing instantly and much more cost effectively.

And this does spin to one thing I would be hyper-optimistic about. I do think this memory issue is a big, big deal, at least on the consumer side. So none of the major contenders today can remember who you are because it would require them. And I mean, remember over five years, 10 years to really become a personal assistant kind of thing that Her represented. And it's because you'd have to redo the model for each human. And of course, that makes no sense economically. So it's actually a huge structural problem. There are complaints, you know, in Reddit about character AI on this front. I think all of the people sitting atop these companies know that this is a huge breakthrough opportunity. And the first one that gets to it, I think, could outrun whoever the contender is at that moment in time. Because the things you could do, if it could remember everyone in your contact database, you know, all your emails that you've done, like the thing, the personal productivity an individual could have, if this thing could be that way. And I think most of the press. Thinks it'll be that way tomorrow. And no one's really solved this problem yet. I think it's a huge opportunity."

It's just we're not going to get the local community, you know, benefits, we're not going to get the local tax dollar benefits. And then we're certainly when they go off and leave one of our companies, they're going to build a company that is in and native to their, you know, their country, and then and then it's over. And we just have to pray that that is not the next Apple or Google or Microsoft. And otherwise, you just flip the entire, you know, kind of economic environment. And so it's just very frustrating. This is just happens to be a chart of H1B demand and applications, you know, per year, it's actually like, not even that interesting a graph, because if you actually looked at the true demand, if you could measure how many people actually wanted, and were capable and qualified to work in the US, the number would be, you know, five times larger. And again, we are currently employing all these people, this is not going to be a problem. And so we're going to have to, you know, we're going to have to reduce US jobs, that they are employed, there's no way like, like, you know, the kind of responses I always get is like somebody will randomly some troll will be like, you're just, you know, trying to take US jobs. It's like, no, no, no, like, no matter what this person on the other end is going to be employed by by our company, they're just not going to be living in the US and improving our economy. And so it's crazy. And I think that, you know, we I'm a part of a, you know, kind of a tech lobbying kind of group or whatever we, you know, lobby about all the things all the time. And, and so we'll meet with Congress and talk to the senators and, and Congress, you know, people about this. And, and, and what is what's really sad is that, you know, on a one on one basis, everybody right, left, everywhere in between agrees with the issue. And there's just always one thing that's holding it up. It's no, we have to solve the whole immigration package, or we can't give this one, you know, we can't give into this particular deal that we're working on. And so this one little number, in a document, i.e. the quota that we have, you just change that one number, and our whole problem goes away. And nobody's willing to do it. Nobody's willing to just like sign up for that project in Congress to say, I'm going to do it."

I think the biggest thing that we probably lose by not increasing that is this future founder thing that you're talking about. And on one hand, it's kind of impossible to numerate why that could be so huge.
